I always want the scoreboard and game history on the left no matter how many players there are from 2-7 and then the gameplay and the rest of the information in the middle and to the right. It is fine to make the width of those parts to the left a bit greater and reduce the size of the text and spacing between names if necessary in order to make it compact enough to avoid the user needing to scroll to see all the information. I want it to be easy to see what is going on for the user.

I also want the user to be able to return to the main menu at any point. There should be a button enabling this at the top of the screen.

I also want to add one more game mode which will be called "The Whist Olympics" and the button to enter it will show up in between Single Player and Multiplayer on the main menu. It will be a tournament where there are 49 players all from different countries with little flags next to their names - their names will be randomly generated but will include a random adjective in front of the first name (first names only, no surnames) and I want there to be 200 different adjectives to choose from (so they might be Lazy Francesca or Argumentative Billy or Kind Gary or Brave Edward etc). They will be randomly drawn into 7 different tables of 7 players with the winner of the first game on each of the 7 tables qualifying for the Grand Final - the rules of the games will be as normal. The user will be shown the table draws for all the tables after that part is done and will then click to start qualification round whereby each of the 7 games will be simulated concurrently. After the qualifying round, the results will be shown to the user and there will be a short match report generated for each table which will be full of hyperbole and based on the results and the adjectives of each player (that will suit their character). Then the user will click to play the Final Table - they will play in it only if they won their first game to qualify, otherwise it will be simulated. Either way, after the game, there will be results shown and a celebration of the winner with a quote related to winning and their adjective.
